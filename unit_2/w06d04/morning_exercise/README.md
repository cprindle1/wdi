## C.R.A.P. Web Design

The four principals that may be the most important for graphic designers are:

**C**ontrast<br>
**R**epetition<br>
**A**lignment<br>
**P**roximity<br>

### Contrast
A reader should always be able to glance at a document and instantly understand what's going on. Add contrast through your typeface choices, line thicknesses, colors, shapes, sizes, space, etc.

### Repetition
Repetition is simply the process of repeating elements throughout a design, or several pieces of design collateral to give a unified look.   The repetitive element may be a bold font, a thick line, a certain bullet, color, design element, particular format, spatial relationship, etc. It can be anything that a reader will visually recognize as being a “theme.”

### Alignment
Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page. When items are aligned, the result is a stronger cohesive unit.

Be conscious of where you place the elements (line, image, type)
Always find something else on the page to align with, even if the two objects are physically far away from each other.

### Proximity
Unity helps all the elements look like they belong together.  The concept of unity describes the relationship between the individual parts and the whole of a composition. Unity in design is a concept that stems from theories of visual perception and psychology, specifically those dealing with how the human brain organizes visual information into categories, or groups.

When you create something, you already know which pieces of information are logically connected, you know which information should be emphasized and what can be de-emphasized. Express that information graphically by grouping it.

# Activity

## The Mockup

Remember this mockup from week 1? Let's do some C.R.A.P. to it to make it better!

## Let's Modify It!

1. Open up the files in the `crappy_mockup` folder. Open the application in your browser so that you can see the adjustments as we make them.

### What can we do to adjust this page?

**C**ontrast<br>
**R**epetition<br>
**A**lignment<br>
**P**roximity<br>

### Ideas:

**C**ontrast<br>
- Change the colors to be more dramatically different.
- Make the image larger so that the header stands out from the rest of the body.
- Remove that gap at the top to keep the contrast more purposeful.

**R**epetition<br>
- Bring in another font that we can use on the headings that is different from the paragraph text.
- Use a grid system to line up elements in a consistent way.

**A**lignment<br>
- Update the alignment to be either all center or to the right or left (not both).

**P**roximity<br>
- This is set up to a nice degree with the headers in each section, but we could move where that "Articles" title is to make it more cohesive (after the line). Perhaps some additional margins to further give a sense of separate sections for the articles.
