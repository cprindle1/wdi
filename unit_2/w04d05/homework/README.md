## Node Practice

### Node.js - Node Package Manager

Read this short [article and watch this video](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) about NPM.

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvGjaqZducI&list=PLw1xVKFbouemJxSHuHggMQ97C3OECH1zG&index=4)
 to help you understand node and node packages and check out the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) website.

### Conceptual Questions
1. What is a node package?

2. Give two examples of a node package.

3. How do you initialize node package manager for a directory?

4. Which file will always appear in your directory when you do `npm init`?

5. Research the node package 'Express' and explain why we might want to use it.

# Hungry for More?
If you have any energy left, and want to get some practice in with node, follow the directions below. Under each question, write the line of code that you used in the terminal to accomplish each task (refer back to the video above if you need help).

1. Create folder and a .js file called `npmtest`.
2. install node package manager.
3. modify the .json file so that you will be able to type "start" in node to execute your npmtest file.
4. install the npm color package and require it in your npmtest file.
5. make the following sentence display in a zebra color: "Guess my favorite animal...".

## Extra Bonus
