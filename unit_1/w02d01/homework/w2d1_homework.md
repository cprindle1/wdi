# Datatypes

So far we have seen:

* Strings
* Numbers
* Booleans
* Arrays
* Objects

When these datatypes are combined, we get a **data structure**, for example, an array that contains objects that each contain booleans.

Let's say you are tasked with creating some software, and it is up to **you** to determine which datatypes and what data structure to use.

For each of the following, write which **datatypes** you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the **data structure**:

* A lightswitch that can be either on or off.
* A user's email address.
* A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
* A list of wdi-remote-hopper student names.
* A list of wdi-remote-hopper student names each with a location.
* A list of wdi-remote-hopper student names each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.

## Monkeys!

### Array of objects with arrays and objects

1. Create an array called `monkeys`.<br>
2. Inside the array, create three objects that have the following properties:<br>
    - name
    - species
    - foodsEaten (this should be an array. List more than one food item per monkey.)
    - favoriteColors (this should be an object. List the favorite "bright" color and the favorite "dull" color).
<br>

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.**<br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"2nd commit - created array of monkey objects".
<hr>

<br>
<hr>

4. Console log all of the monkeys.<br>

5. Console log just the first monkey object.<br>

6. Console log the `foodsEaten` of the 2nd monkey.<br>

7. Create an empty array called `monkey_names`. Use a **for loop** to iterate over the array of monkey objects, and  and save all of the names of the monkeys to the `monkey_names` array. _hint:_ use `.push()`.

8. Create an empty array called `monkey_colors` and save all of the favorite colors of the monkeys from the `monkeys` array.<br>

The commit message should read: <br>

# Object-ception

With the following object:

```
var inception = {
   reality: {
       dreamLayer1: {
           dreamLayer2: {
               dreamLayer3: {
                   dreamLayer4: {
                       dreamLayer5: {
                           dreamLayer6: {
                               limbo: "Mallorie"
                          }
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
}
```

Change the value of `limbo` to `null`.

# BONDFILMS

];
```
 
Yikes. Well, copy the bondFilms **array** of **objects** above into your js file. Use **for loops** and conditionals and methods in order to complete the below:

* Create a new array called `bondTitles` with only the titles of the Bond films, and console.log the new array.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"5th commit - Made an array of bond titles".
<hr>

* Create a new array `oddBonds`, of only the Bond films released on odd-numbered years.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"6th commit - made an array of odd bonds".
<hr>

* Determine the total cumulative gross of the Bond franchise, and console.log the result. _hint_ To make the grosses into usable numbers, look into the `.replace` Javascript method (there are many ways to do this, however). Look into `parseInt` also. 

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"7th commit - determined the bond films gross".

# Hungry For More?

CHALLENGE

`bondFilms` again!

- Console log the single movie **object** that contains the actor who starred in the least number of films.

Expected result:

```
{ "title" : "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", "year" : 1969, "actor" : "George Lazenby", "gross" : "$505,899,782" }
```

You should arrive at this result by comparing the frequency of actors.

_hint:_ Objects by definition have **unique** keys. Later in the problem you could create a new object wherein all the Bond actors are keys, and unique, with no doubles. 

_another hint:_ You might come to a place where you will want to iterate over an object. You can iterate over arrays, but did you know you can iterate over objects? 

You can either use `Object.keys()`, documentation [here - Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)

Or, you can use a `for ... in` loop, documentation [here - for ... in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)

<br>

### More on `for ... in`

The syntax for iterating over an object with `for ... in` is:

```
for (var key in obj) {
	// stuff, such as console.log(key)
}
```

Where `key` is a variable that instantiates for the keys in object, and `obj` is the name 
of the object you are iterating over. So, if you just wanted to console.log all the **keys** in the first bondFilms object, you could write:

```
for (var key in bondFilms[0]) {
	console.log(key);
}
```

Also remember, you can use a variable to access a key in an object, with bracket notation:

`obj[key]` will look for the property in the object that corresponds to whatever the 
variable `key` is. This is very different to the syntax `obj['key']` (notice the quotes) that will look for a key _named_ key, rather than a variable.

To print all of the **values** in the first bondFilms object, you could write:

```
for (var key in bondFilms[0]) {
	console.log(bondFilms[0][key]);
}
```
Good luck!
