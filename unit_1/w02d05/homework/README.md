# OOP Game

You will be making a console game **according to a specification.** 

You have a choice between:

* **Castle Battle!**
* **Hangman**

The game must use the OOP design pattern. Not everything has to be in an object (OOP), but there should be: 

* at least one object with methods.
* at least one constructor function.

Look at these markdowns in order --

1. Castle Battle
2. Hangman

Choose one. Make a github issue on the **main repo** with your name and the title of the game (Castle Battle or Hangman). Once you have chosen, you cannot change your mind or you will not have time to complete the game.

Neither of these assignments is inherently more difficult than the other. Choose one according to what you think you get the most out of:

Choose **Castle battle** if you would get the most out of a 'blank slate' and planning the game from scratch. There is no code or suggested code provided for you.

Choose **Hangman** if you want some functions and objects provided for you. You will have to work out what should go in those functions and objects, and what the intentions are for them.

Both games can be equally challenging, just in different ways. Both games will give you what you need to proceed in the course.

The key thing to remember is to **plan your game.**

## Commits

This is your time to commit when a commit will make sense. There is no prescribed number of commits.

**Commit when you have something working.**

As soon as you have the smallest piece of working code, commit your work. Keep committing as you increase the functionality of your game.

We will be looking at your commits.

### Sneak peek / inspiration for Project 1

**projects by previous students**

* [Blackjack](https://cardosi.github.io/)
* [Piggy](https://shreiya.github.io/piggy/)
* [Tic Tac Toe](http://sepowitz.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)
* [Connect Four](http://katiezhou.github.io/connectfour.html)
* [Blackjack pixel art](http://kwwalter.github.io/retro-blackjack/)
* [Snake](https://awdriggs.github.io/snake/)

Project 1 varies from cohort to cohort, but the material learned during the unit is the same. You will have an opportunity to put your HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge together in creative ways. We will let you know what you will be making for your Project 1 at the end of next week, but for now, check out these projects for inspiration.
