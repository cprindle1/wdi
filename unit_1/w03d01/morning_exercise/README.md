# Morning Exercise

## Setup
None! You don't have to save your code into a file today.

## Directions
Happy Monday! You get to play a game this morning:

[Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

The point of the game is to move the frog(s) (the element) onto the lily pads.

There is a CSS file started for you and they have already included `display: flex;` inside the styles area. This means that you can use flexbox!

Read the directions and then use then use CSS properties to align the frogs to their pads.

## Hungry for More?

Create these mockups using Flexbox!
