# Morning Exercise

## Setup

Use the `index.html` and `style.css` inside your `responsive_mockups` folder in your `morning_exercise` folder for today.

## Pair Programming
You will be pair-programming to solve today's morning exercise. Note that we will be doing this multiple times throughout the cohort, so you will all get a chance to be a driver and an observer. Embrace the position that you have in the moment.

### Driver
- You will be the person who is typing during this exercise.

- You should share your screen with your partner. Before you code anything, you should **vocalize** what you are doing and ask your partner for their opinion.

- Share the code that was written (via Github or Slack) with your partner once the exercise has ended.

### Observer / Passenger
You will be watching as your partner writes the code. It is your job to be vocal with your ideas, but you won't be dictating the code.

You should think about it at a higher level and ask things like "How would this piece of code handle this type of situation?" and "What are we outputting?", or "What are we trying to achieve?"
