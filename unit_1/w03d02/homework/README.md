# Homework

## Lord of the Rings

![LOTR](http://wallpapercave.com/wp/KzQhmyc.jpg)

## Learning Objectives

- Practice using jQuery to manipulate the DOM

---
We are going to take a trip from the Shire, through Rivendell, across Middle
Earth, and into the heart of Mordor itself, Mount Doom. Pack up, because we're
going on an adventure.

## Setup

Inside the folder `lotr_homework` are files that you will be using to complete your homework tonight. There is an `index.html` file, an `app.js` file, and a `style.css` sheet. **You will be adding code to the `app.js` file.** You will be doing a _tiny_ bit of work in the CSS file. You should not touch the HTML file.

Open the `app.js` file. Observe the arrays of people and places and the 13 chapters that have been included. Each chapter has a button with a click handler in the html file, and an associated javascript function in app.js. Your job is to **fill in the code inside the JS functions** to get the application working as intended.

:elephant: Remember that you can check your **DOM tree** in the **Elements tab** in the Chrome Console.

## Workflow

Tackle this problem one function at a time from start to finish.

* When you begin, write a console.log inside of the function that you are working on to check that the event listener works when you click the associated button.

* Write the correct DOM manipulatory code inside the function and check that it
  works.

NOTE: Each function depends on the previous ones, so make sure your function works
before moving on to the next one!

Every time you **refresh** the page, you will have to **click the buttons** one by one
**in order from the beginning** to operate your application. (If really don't want
the popups after you've completed a step, you can check to disable each popup and speed up the process of debugging).

## Commits

Commit your work after each function is complete and working properly

## Need a jQuery Reminder?

If you need help remember all of the jQuery DOM commands, check out the file inside this `homework` folder called `cheatsheet_jquery_commands`.
